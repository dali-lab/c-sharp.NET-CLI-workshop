# Workshop: Creating Your Own Command Line Tools with C# and the .NET Core SDK

In this workshop, we'll create our very own command line tool called `kronos` to help keep track of our work time and assist in logging hours on Kronos.

This workshop serves as a basic introduction into C# and the .NET Framework. We use the .NET Core SDK 3.1 to build this command line tool.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download and install .NET Core 3.1: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `make install` within the repository.
